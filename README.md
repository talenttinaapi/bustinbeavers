# Bustin Beavers

## Overview
**Bustin Beavers** is an automated testing project for a web-based game using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) testing framework. The tests simulate user interactions with the game, such as navigating to the game page, clicking on elements within a canvas, and interacting with various UI components.

This project is designed to ensure the game's functionality and user experience remain consistent across updates.

## Features
- Automated navigation to the game URL.
- Simulated user interactions with the game canvas.
- Interaction with UI elements like the info bar and help section.
- Reuse of a single browser instance for efficient testing.
